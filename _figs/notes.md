## Figure 1
* Standard deviation of three pairs
* Answer to questions: I would like to become friends with my music partner; If my music partner needed help, I would help them; I would trust my music partner with a secret
* Other questions: I enjoyed playing music with my music partner; I would like to play again with my music partner; When I was the "follower", I had no trouble musically accompanying my music partner
* Planning on doing a paired t-test (one directional because we have hypothesis) when we have more people

* Data before preprocessing (hM_4B_pCloA_EEG3)

## Figure 5
* Data after preprocessing


## Figure 6
* Filtering response
* Why use a Kaiswer window? Becuase it approximates the Slepian window in a very effective way and maximizes the energy concentration in the main lobe
* Note that the magnitude of the filter is squared, emulating the output ofr filtfilt (zero phase filtering)


## Figure 7
* Equation for pct change
* Please note that I am only taking the absolute value of the Hilbert transform (i.e. the envelope)



## Questions for committee:
* How to approach statistical significance? Specially with NSTE maps; if a map is not significant in one pair but it is in another pair, what kind of statistics should I use? Or should I just keep like the 30% strongest activations in a given set?
